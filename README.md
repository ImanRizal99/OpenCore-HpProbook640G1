## Disclaimer
* I am not responsible for any damage caused to your components, data loss, or anything else that may happen throughout this process.
* No selling of EFI folder (config) that's readily available for free.
* Discrette Graphics will be disabled, since it is not supported under macOS Big Sur.

## Important Notes
* Due to the limitation and quirkness of the HP bios installed on this laptop, if you only have one M.2 SSD installed, you will need to install additional SATA HDD for booting. Look at FAQ for more information.
* Airportitlwm.kext requires specific macOS version to function. Include in this repo is for BigSur. For Catalina use, download the kext [here](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases) specific for Catalina and put it in the kext folder replacing the other one.

## Kexts Included / Credits
* [Lilu.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu) - Arbitrary kext that is required other kexts to work like AppleALC.kext.
* [RTCMemoryFixup.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/RTCMemoryFixup) - Emulate some offsets in CMOS (RTC) memory. Avoid some conflicts between AppleRTC and firmware/BIOS of the Laptop.
* [VirtualSMC.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC) - Advanced Apple SMC emulator in the kernel. Requires Lilu for full functioning.
* [WhateverGreen.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen) - Lilu plugin providing patches to select GPUs on macOS.
* [Wireless](https://openintelwireless.github.io)
   * [Airportilwm.kext](https://github.com/win1010525/Airportitlwm-kext) - Enables Wifi on Intel Chip. Uses Apple's IO80211Family. It provides certain Airport features. It's not as stable as itlwm.kext.
   * [IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware) - Enables native Bluetooth support on Intel Chip.
   * [IntelBluetoothInjector.kext](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware)
* Audio
   * [AppleALC.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC) - Enables audio on a hackintosh.
* Ethernet
   * [IntelMausi.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/IntelMausi) â€“ Enables ethernet for motherboards using an Intel Ethernet Chipset.
* USB / WebCam
   * USBMapHP640G1.kext
* Keyboard / Mouse
   * [VoodooPS2Controller.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/VoodooPS2) - VoodooPS2Trackpad uses VoodooInput's Magic Trackpad II emulation in order to use macOS native driver instead of handling all gestures itself. This enables the use of any from one to four finger gestures defined by Apple


## FAQ
* Why this laptop won't boot from M.2 SSD?
  * Due to the limitation of the HP Bios on this laptop, it does not support booting directly from the M.2 SSD (i don't know why). 
If you intend to use M.2 drive for macOS, you HAVE to have at least one SATA disk for EFI booting. This drive is where we will store the EFI later and boot into. 
USB drive can also be used for booting, although its not recommended.
 
* I'm using a different type of NVMe m.2 ssd, and as soon as I installed macOS on it, it kernel panic.
   * In that case, please download NVme.kext and put it inside the EFI/OC/Kext folder, then do a clean snapshot or manually update the config.plist

* Can i sell this EFI?
   * NO
