## Disclaimer
* I am not responsible for any damage caused to your components, data loss, or anything else that may happen throughout this process.

* Due to the limitation of the HP Bios, it does not support booting directly from the M.2 SSD. 
If you intend to use M.2 drive for macOS, you HAVE to have at least one more SATA disk for EFI booting. This drive is where we will store the EFI later. 
USB drive can also be used for booting, although its not recommended.

* Discrette Graphics will be disabled, since it is not supported under macOS Big Sur.
